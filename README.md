CakePHP Extension
=================

This is an experiment of porting some classes from CakePHP to a PHP extension
using [Zephir](http://zephir-lang.com).

**This is only an experiment. Do not use in production!**

This project do not replace CakePHP and it will never will. The goal of this
project is to improve Cake's performance in production.

Feel free to contribute. :smile:
